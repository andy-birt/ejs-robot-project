## About this Project

This is the Robot project from [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html). The goal is to use some Object Oriented approach to building the robot, which for the most part so far, I've achieved.

This project can be ran using Node if you have it installed. Once you clone this repo and in your CLI of choice navigate to the repo folder /src and execute main.js

```
cd src/
node main.js
```

I intentionally did not install any node modules or packages as I wasn't completely sure I would be able to export the classes I needed to make this work but I wanted to try. I will continue to update this as I finish the project.
